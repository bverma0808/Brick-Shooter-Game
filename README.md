# Brick-Shooter-Game
A game built using HTML5 Canvas, Javascript and CSS

I made this game just for fun. Don't know whether it shows best practices or not.
The game has just two files->
     
A HTML file which serves as the VIEW file and a Javascript file which contains the main engine of our game, 
it serves as the CONTROLLER for the game

The Game has 5 Levels, In each level there is a target which specifies the number of bricks to be destroyed. For each level there are certain number of bullets, and certain number of bricks which will show up. And if the bullets of the player are finished prior to reaching the target , OR all the bricks are passed away then in that case "GAME OVER" message will be displayed.

With each new level, the target score will increase , the number of assigned bullets will increase and the speed of bricks will also increase. And after finishing level 5 , after displaying a success message the game will start again from level 1. 

And if one fails to clear any level, then the game starts from level 1.
